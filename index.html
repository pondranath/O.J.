        Generally, since young, I have always been interested in the art of problem solving. Whether it be solving a Rubik's cube, or doing Mathematics problems, the stages of problem solving always gave me immense satisfaction. Especially during Mathematics, when the problem is multi-layered and ties many concepts together, that is when my interest is most piqued. As such, I decided to specialise in Mathematics (taking Further Maths) as I wanted to further progress my career in maths. At that point, I was also very interested in programming, as it was very closely linked to Mathematics, as it employed concepts like algorithms. From that point onward, I tried to find links between Mathematics and programming, such as optimising certain solutions. For example, instead of using recursion for finding the nth Fibonacci number, you can use a general recurrence relation formula. My goal is to find more ways to intertwine Math and programming to make solving problems more efficient with fewer resources. Other than programming, I have a huge interest in AI as it is a core part of the future and can open more doors to almost any discipline, like medicine, computing, etc. Right now, I am researching how AI can optimise financial decisions like investing and timing when to invest. On this website, you can refer to the achievements section for my academic achievements and the 'personal projects' section for my endeavours like competitive programming, and game development.
