      <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
      <p>
        Based on my profile, I have demonstrated the ability to solve problems within the 1800-2000 elo range on CodeChef, which is around 3-4 stars. (Please refer to the recent activity tab to see the problems I have recently submitted, and you can check their elos.) 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Competitive programming is interesting to me not just because of the competitive aspect but because it's similar to solving puzzles using code. And each solution has to be general, and has to apply to all test cases, so it fosters more critical thinking. As of now, I am focusing my efforts on learning more about backtracking and DFS search (generating permutations, depth of binary tree). These will definitely help in my competitive programming journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have done some questions on codewars to improve my coding skills, and codewars questions are kind of a mix between leetcode and a bit of competitive programming.

      <h2>Blender/Unity</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently aiming to develop an FPS game that is single player. For now, I have made some very basic models of the guns in blender, and I am using unity as the game engine. Below are the images of some of the gun models I have created.

      <h2>Math</h2>
      <p>
        Due to my significant interest in Math, I am currently pursuing greater applications of linear algebra and revising it based on my Further Math studies (Transformations, rank theorem, vector spaces). I am also looking at the H3 Math syllabus and studying various ways of proving mathematical statements (Induction, proof by infinite descent).
